# Fix bug

Fix the cause of a bug, not its symptom, and leave a test behind that fails
without the fix.

## Steps

### 1. Reproduce the bug

- Restate the observed and the expected behavior in one sentence each.
- Reproduce the bug with the smallest command or input you can find. Build the
  project first with the build task described in `CLAUDE.md`.
- If you can't reproduce it, stop and ask the user for the missing details. Do
  not fix a bug you haven't seen.

### 2. Find the root cause

- Trace the failure from the symptom back to the code that makes the wrong
  decision. Read the code; don't guess from names.
- Ask "why" until the answer is a line of code or a wrong assumption, not a
  side effect of one.
- Check the architecture docs in `docs/architecture` for the structure of the
  project and any known pitfalls.
- Write down the root cause in one or two sentences. If several causes are
  plausible, rule them out one by one with evidence.

### 3. Write a failing test

- Add a test that reproduces the bug through the public interface of the
  affected module, next to the existing tests. Follow the test conventions
  already used in the project.
- Prefer a unit test. Use an integration test only when the bug depends on an
  external system, such as a database, a network service, or the file system.
- Run it and confirm it fails for the reason you found in step 2.

### 4. Fix the root cause

- Make the smallest change that fixes the cause. Follow the engineering
  guidelines in `docs/engineering`.
- Look for the same mistake elsewhere in the code and fix it there as well.

### 5. Verify

- Run the new test and confirm it passes.
- Run the format, lint, and test tasks described in `CLAUDE.md`. Run the
  integration tests as well when the fix touches code that they cover.
- Repeat the reproduction from step 1 and confirm the bug is gone.

### 6. Report

Tell the user the root cause, the fix, the test that covers it, and any
related spots you changed. Suggest a commit message of the form
`fix(<scope>): <description>`.
